<p>Tooling board is our most popular tooling material option for low volume prototype production runs. We always keep plenty in stock ready for your orders. It is a great option for multiple pulls of parts with simple geometry and is a quick tooling solution to manufacture a one-off prototype of more complex parts.</p>

<p>Plyable stock a range of Epoxy and PU (polyurethane) tooling board materials all of which are listed on our <a href="https://test-dot-mouldbox1.appspot.com/materials.html">material guide</a>. Epoxy tooling board moulds have the advantage that they can be used at elevated cure temperatures and are therefore the recommended choice for prototyping components using pre-preg manufacturing process.</p>

<p>PU tooling board is a great mould material choice for manufacturing processes where parts are cured at ambient temperatures and is also perfect for making jigs and fixtures. Our designers can advise on all aspects of composite tooling design including materials, curing, and geometry.</p>

<p>An epoxy tooling board is suitable for manufacturing composite components using these processes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Pre-preg</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Resin infusion</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wet lay</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jigs and fixtures</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="manufacture">Manufacture</h2>

<p>Tooling board moulds are made by creating removing material from a block using a CNC mill.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Plyable takes component CAD model and tools are designed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tooling board sheets are bonded together to the required volume.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The material is machined to the correct geometry on a 5-axis CNC mill.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moulds are hand-finished to remove machining marks and create a smooth surface finish.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspected for quality and shipped.</p>
