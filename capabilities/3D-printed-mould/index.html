<p>3D printing can be an effective way to manufacture composite tooling. With materials like ULTEM 1010 the technology can be used for high temperature composite lay-up and repair tools as well as sacrificial tooling.</p>

<h2 id="material">Material</h2>

<p>The 3D printing process generally has looser tolerances than the CNC milling process used in tooling board and CFRP mould manufacture. The nature of the process also results in a less glossy surface finish. However for the right job it means less material waste and can be done fast. Another option is 3D print the mould and then use CNC milling to reach the appropriate tolerance and surface quality.</p>
